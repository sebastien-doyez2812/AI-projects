# ðŸ¤– DIY Robotic Arm with AI and Computer Vision ðŸ¤–

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an AI that can detect a cube and command a robotic arm to grab it and place it in a specific location. This is similar to a project I previously completed at ETS ([link to project](https://github.com/sebastien-doyez2812/Internship_projects/tree/main/MEA4_internship)).

This time, the code is open source! It can serve as a great base for your own project. Feel free to use it, but don't forget to credit me ðŸ˜œ.

## ðŸ“– Libraries Used ðŸ“–
You can install all the necessary libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file (pip install -r requirements.txt) , or install them one by one:

- **pyserial**: `pip install pyserial`
- **opencv (cv2)**: `pip install opencv-python`
- **Yolo (YOLOv8)**: `pip install ultralytics`
- **numpy**: `pip install numpy`

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Demonstration ðŸŽ¬
You can watch a video demonstration of the project [here](https://github.com/sebastien-doyez2812/AI-projects/blob/main/DIY_Robotic_arm_and_AI/video_demo.mp4).
